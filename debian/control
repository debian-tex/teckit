Description: Encoding conversion tools for plain text files
 TECkit is a toolkit for encoding conversions. It offers a simple format for
 describing the mapping between legacy 8-bit encodings and Unicode, and a
 set of utilities based on such descriptions for converting text between 8-bit
 and Unicode encodings.
 .
 It also includes a compiler for a mapping description language that allows for
 bidirectional conversion description (i.e. the same description is used for
 conversion to and from Unicode).

Description: Development files for TECkit encoding conversion library
 TECkit is a toolkit for encoding conversions. It offers a simple format for
 describing the mapping between legacy 8-bit encodings and Unicode, and a
 set of utilities based on such descriptions for converting text between 8-bit
 and Unicode encodings.
 .
 It also includes a compiler for a mapping description language that allows for
 bidirectional conversion description (i.e. the same description is used for
 conversion to and from Unicode).
 .
 This package contains development files to allow linking to libTECkit
 for data conversion, and libTECkit_Compiler to compile mappings.
